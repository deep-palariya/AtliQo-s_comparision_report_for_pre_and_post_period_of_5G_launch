# Problem Statement
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.
However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active user.
# Task

- 2.The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
- 3.Create relevant insights not provided in the dashboard to support the cause.
# Tools and Technology Used
- MySQL
  - view
  - Window Function
- Power BI Desktop
   - Report
   - Dashboard
   - Power Query
   - Data Modelling

# My Approach to problem
- 1.Understanding the Business Requirements, Dataset and KPIs.
- 2.create a view by joining given datasets tables to have required facts and dimensions tables.
- 3.Imported Data to PBI desktop.
- 6.Model Tables by managing relationships between them.
- 4.Created a Separate Specific table for % change in measure by Before 5G and After 5G.
- 5.Visualized graphs/ tables keeping KPIs in mind.
- 7.At Last, Summarized some key Recommendations & Insights.
# Learning from this Project
- 1.A better approach to find KPIs by Using Dax creating Measures and calculated Columns to get the required figures on visuals.
- 2.Customization of report and power query.
- 3.Work with relationship model to create new table by using DAX queries.
